I am an student of **Software Developement** who constantly seeks out innovative solutions to everyday problems. In my learning in this industry, I've honed my analytical thinking and collaboration skills, and I love working with a team. Currently, currently I am pursuing Programmer Analyst course at Lasalle College.

In the next 5 years, I'd like to move into a Senior Developer role. A position like this, senior software engineer job would let me gain more experience with project management and leadership.
